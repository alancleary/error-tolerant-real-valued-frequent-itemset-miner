This project is a validation study of the work done in [1][1].
In essence, it is a Python implementation of an error-tolerant real-valued frequent itemset mining algorithm with an application to Breast Cancer microarray gene expression data.
The implementation is composed of two parts: 1) an implementation of Approximate Frequent Itemsets (AFI) [2][2] and 2) an extension of AFI to work with real-valued data via the *range* and *RangeSupport* measures from Range Support Pattern (RAP) [3][3].

The first implementation will be tested on data generated by the IBM Quest Synthetic Data Set Generator [4][4].
The second implementation will be tested on four Breast Cancer microarray data sets from the Affymetrix platform HGU133A, specifically, Desmedt (GSE7390), Loi (GSE6532), Miller (GSE3494), and Pawitan (PSE1456).
All these data sets will be aquired from the Gene Ontology Consortium [5][5].
